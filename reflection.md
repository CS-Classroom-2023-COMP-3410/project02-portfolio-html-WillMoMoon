to access the website use

The first thing I should do in the future is set aside mroe time to work on projects

The first step I did was get the main functions of the website setup, such as navigation to all five pages. This was quite straight forward 
Next I just used the layout of the home page as a template for the rest of the pages

But for this project specifically, Most of it was fairly straight forward
The most annoying part was compressing images, and organizing the HTML and Photos,
in the future I need to do that from the begining since going back and chaning file locations takes a bit.
